I am a Ph.D. student at the Genomic Signal Processing Lab led by [Professor Aniruddha Datta](https://engineering.tamu.edu/electrical/profiles/adatta.html) at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University, College Station. My research thrust focuses on applying probabilistic graphical networks such as Bayesian Networks to model gene-protein interaction in signal transduction pathways of crops. I have used Bayesian Networks to identifying gene regulators in drought defensive pathways in Arabidopsis; the results were published in our work in 2019.  My current research involves increasing the Lysine (Protein) content in Rice.
